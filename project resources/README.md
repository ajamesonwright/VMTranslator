# VMTranslator

This software will be written to follow along with the "Nand to Tetris, Part 2" course as shown here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/

Initial commit: basic layout of program
  - Main class - entry point
  - Parser class - create parser object to handle opening and parsing of *.VM files
  - CodeWriter class - create CodeWriter object to handle processing of parsed strings to output file
  - GUI class - visual interface, event handlers, etc.

Since this is my first Git project and it may someday be viewed by others, I am trying to adhere to Java best practices to make something polished and professional.
